There should be only one first-level heading (#) per .Rmd file. 2.1 Interpreting and Creating Drawings 2.1.1 Introduction to Engineering Working Drawings (Hijazi 2025) 2.1.1.1 Engineering Working Drawings Basics Engineering graphics is an effective way of communicating technical ideas and it is an essential tool in engineering design where most of the design process is graphically based. Engineering graphics is used in the design process for visualization, communication, and documentation. Graphics is a visual communications language that include images, text, and numeric information. Graphics communications using engineering drawings and models is a clear and precise language with definite rules that must be mastered in order to be successful in engineering design. Graphics communications are used in every phase of engineering design starting from concept illustration all the way to the manufacturing phase. An engineering (or technical) drawing is a graphical representation of a part, assembly, system, or structure and it can be produced using freehand, mechanical tools, or computer methods. Working drawings are the set of technical drawings used during the manufacturing phase of a product. They contain all the information needed to manufacture and assemble a product. 2.1.1.2 Codes and Standards Codes and standards are made to organize and unify the engineering work. Imagine; what if there was no standard for bolts? A code is a set of specifications for the analysis, design, manufacture, and construction of something. A standard is a set of specifications for parts, materials, or processes intended to achieve uniformity, efficiency and specific quality. Organizations Examples of the organizations that establish standards and design codes include: ISO, AISI, SAE, ASTM, ASME, ANSI, DIN. There are many different standards related to technical drawings. The ISO standards for technical drawings are found in a two-volume handbook: ISO Standards Handbook: Technical drawings, Volume 1: Technical drawings in general. ISO Standards Handbook: Technical drawings, Volume 2: Mechanical engineering drawings; Construction drawings; Drawing equipment. 2.1.1.3 Drawing Sheet Layout Standard layouts of drawing sheets are specified by the various standards organizations. The figure below shows the layout of a typical sheet, showing the drawing frame, a typical title block, parts list (bill of materials), and revision table. Figure 2.1: Title Block of Technical Drawing 2.1.1.3.1 Title Block Components (Lorier 2025) Part Title: The title is a descriptive name given to the drawing, typically the largest box in the title block. Company Information: The name of the company responsible for the drawing will also appear in a larger box in the title block. Often, a logo for the company will be displayed as well. Size: The size block displays the letter of the sheet size of the print (e.g., A, B, C, or A4, A3). Drawing Number: A numbering system the company uses to aid in filing and tracking the drawing. Part Number: A part number may be used to identify a specific part, such as in an assembly parts list. Scale: The scale displays the proportion of the drawing compared to the object. Reduction: When the part is too large to fit on the sheet, the drawing may be reduced to \\(1/2, 1/4, 1/8\\), etc. Enlargement: When the part is smaller than the sheet, the drawing may be increased proportionally. “DO” Scale: The ratio is arranged as Drawing:Object. A scale of 1:2 indicates the drawing is half the size of the part. A scale of 2:1 indicates the drawing is twice the size of the part. A scale of 1:1 or “Full” indicates they are the same size. NTS: Stands for “Not To Scale,” used if the drawing does not follow a basic proportional size. Drawn: Contains the name or initials of the drafter and the date of the drawing, as well as any other individuals involved (checkers, engineers). Projection: Identifies whether the drawing is a first-angle or third-angle projection. This is typically indicated with a standard projection cone symbol. Weight: Used to indicate the weight of the finished part when required. Sheet: Displays the current and total number of sheets in that drawing set (e.g., Sheet 1 of 3). Material: Identifies the specific material requirements for the part. Finish: Displays any part finish specifications. These may be indicated for specific regions using leader lines. Application: Used to identify the assemblies on which the part is used. 2.1.1.3.2 Tolerances Default Tolerance Box: Displays the amount of variation allowed on dimension values that do not have a specific tolerance attached to them. These are usually categorized by the number of decimal places. Figure 2.2: Default Tolerances Example based on Figure 7-3: * A two-place dimension of 2.00 allows for a \\(\\pm 0.02\\) tolerance (Range: \\(1.98\\) to \\(2.02\\)). * A three-place dimension of 2.000 allows for a \\(\\pm 0.010\\) tolerance (Range: \\(1.990\\) to \\(2.010\\)). 2.1.1.3.3 Document Control and Layout Revision: Revisions are changes made to the drawing after the original release to correct errors, improve design, or reduce manufacturing costs. The revision level (letter or number) is located in the lower right. The revision history is typically located in the upper right of the sheet. A dash (-) or the letter “A” often indicates the initial release. Zones: Sheet zones (using letters and numbers along the border) help locate particular details or views, which is especially beneficial on large-format drawings. 2.1.2 Dimensioning and Tolerancing Chapters and sections are numbered by default. To un-number a heading, add a {.unnumbered} or the shorter {-} at the end of the heading, like in this section. 2.2 Geometric Dimensioning and Tolerancing (GD&amp;T) References Hijazi, Rd. Ala. 2025.

Therefore, designers must specify an acceptable range of variation. This chapter explores the fundamental concepts of tolerances, basic sizes, and allowances, as defined in standards such as ASME Y14.5 (ASME_Y14_5?). 4.1 Fundamental Concepts To understand tolerancing, we must first define three key terms: Basic Size: The theoretical exact size from which limits of size are derived by the application of allowances and tolerances. Tolerance: The total amount a specific dimension is permitted to vary. It is the difference between the maximum and minimum limits. Allowance: An intentional difference between the maximum material limits of mating parts (e.g., the tightest fit between a shaft and a hole). Mathematically, if we denote the Upper Limit as \\(L_{max}\\) and the Lower Limit as \\(L_{min}\\), the tolerance \\(T\\) is calculated as: \\[ T = L_{max} - L_{min} \\] These concepts apply universally, whether designing a cylindrical shaft diameter, a slot width, or the overall length of a prismatic part. 4.2 Tolerancing Methods There are two primary methods used to express tolerances on technical drawings: Limit Dimensions and Plus-Minus Tolerancing. 4.2.1 Limit Dimensions In limit dimensioning, the high and low limits are specified directly. The machinist does not need to calculate the limits; they are explicitly stated. Example: \\(\\begin{matrix} 25.05 \\\\ 24.95 \\end{matrix}\\) 4.2.2 Plus-Minus Tolerancing This method uses a basic size followed by a permissible variance. This category is further divided based on how the variance is distributed relative to the basic size. 1. Equal Bilateral Tolerance The variation is permitted equally in both directions (plus and minus) from the basic size. Example: \\(25.00 \\pm 0.05\\) 2. Unequal Bilateral Tolerance The variation is permitted in both directions, but the amount differs. Example: \\(25.00 \\,\\, {}^{+0.05}_{-0.02}\\) 3. Unilateral Tolerance The variation is permitted in only one direction (either positive or negative) from the basic size. The limit in the other direction is zero. Example: \\(25.00 \\,\\, {}^{+0.05}_{-0.00}\\) 4.3 Specifying Limits in Tolerancing When defining the permissible variation of a part, designers choose between specifying a range (two limits) or a single boundary (one limit) based on the functional requirements of the feature. 4.3.1 Tolerance with Two Limits (Limit Dimensioning) In this method, the maximum and minimum dimensions are specified directly on the drawing. The tolerance is the absolute difference between these two values. This is the most direct method for a machinist to read, as it eliminates the need for mental math to find the boundaries. Format: The limits are usually placed in a stack, with the high limit on top. Calculation: \\(Tolerance = Upper Limit - Lower Limit\\) Example: For a dimension specified as \\(\\begin{matrix} 1.505 \\\\ 1.495 \\end{matrix}\\) The Upper Limit is \\(1.505\\) The Lower Limit is \\(1.495\\) The Tolerance is \\(0.010\\) Figure 4.1: Allowances with two limits 4.3.2 Tolerance with One Limit (Single Limit) Single-limit dimensioning is used when the dimension in one direction is not critical, or when the “other” limit is naturally constrained by the geometry or the manufacturing process. These are indicated by the suffixes MAX or MIN. MAX (Maximum): Specifies that the feature must not exceed the given value. The lower limit is often zero or determined by the part’s shape. This is commonly used for fillet radii or chamfers to prevent interference with a mating part. Example: \\(R.015 \\text{ MAX}\\) MIN (Minimum): Specifies that the feature must be at least the given value. The upper limit is often determined by the material stock or is not functionally critical. This is commonly used for the depth of holes or the width of a bearing surface. Example: \\(.500 \\text{ MIN}\\) (Full Thread) Figure 4.2: Allowances with a single limit 4.3.3 Comparison Summary Method Syntax Primary Use Case Two Limits \\(\\begin{matrix} High \\\\ Low \\end{matrix}\\) Critical fits (shafts, holes, mating surfaces). One Limit (MAX) \\(.010 \\text{ MAX}\\) Clearance for corners, weight reduction, or edge breaks. One Limit (MIN) \\(.500 \\text{ MIN}\\) Minimum engagement for fasteners or structural thickness. 4.3.4 Visualizing Tolerance Distributions To better understand how manufactured parts align with these limits, we can visualize a production run. Figure 4.3 below simulates a batch of 1000 shafts manufactured with a target diameter of 25.0 mm and a tolerance of \\(\\pm 0.05\\) mm. Figure 4.3: Distribution of manufactured shaft diameters relative to tolerance limits. As seen in Figure 4.3, the dashed red lines represent the Upper Specification Limit (USL) and Lower Specification Limit (LSL). Parts falling outside these lines would be rejected. 4.4 Drawing Standards: Metric vs. Inch One of the most critical aspects of technical documentation is adhering to the specific syntax rules for Metric (SI) and Inch (Imperial) units. These rules differ significantly regarding zero suppression and decimal consistency. 4.4.1 Metric Rules (SI) When dimensioning in millimeters, the following rules apply: Leading Zeros: For dimensions and tolerances less than 1 mm, a leading zero must be used. Correct: \\(0.5\\) Incorrect: \\(.5\\) Decimal Consistency: The number of decimal places can vary between the dimension and the tolerance. Example: \\(25 \\pm 0.25\\) (The basic size has 0 decimals; tolerance has 2). Unilateral Zero: A zero in a unilateral tolerance is written as a single digit “0” without a plus or minus sign. Example: \\(30 \\,\\, {}^{+0.1}_{0}\\) 4.4.2 Inch Rules (Imperial) When dimensioning in inches, the conventions are distinct: Leading Zeros: For dimensions and tolerances less than 1 inch, a leading zero is never used. Correct: \\(.500\\) Incorrect: \\(0.500\\) Decimal Consistency: The number of decimal places must be identical for the dimension and the tolerance. Example: \\(1.000 \\pm .005\\) (Both must show 3 decimal places). Zeros in Tolerances: Bilateral: If a tolerance limit is zero, it still requires a plus or minus sign and must display the same number of decimal places as the dimension to express precision. Example: \\(1.000 \\,\\, {}^{+.005}_{-.000}\\) "],["blocks.html", "Chapter 5 Blocks 5.1 Equations 5.2 Theorems and proofs 5.3 Callout blocks", " Chapter 5 Blocks 5.1 Equations Here is an equation. \\[\\begin{equation} f\\left(k\\right) = \\binom{n}{k} p^k\\left(1-p\\right)^{n-k} \\tag{5.1} \\end{equation}\\] You may refer to using \\@ref(eq:binom), like see Equation (5.1). 5.2 Theorems and proofs Labeled theorems can be referenced in text using \\@ref(thm:tri), for example, check out this smart theorem 5.1.
