There should be only one first-level heading (#) per .Rmd file. 2.1 Interpreting and Creating Drawings 2.1.1 Introduction to Engineering Working Drawings (Hijazi 2025) 2.1.1.1 Engineering Working Drawings Basics Engineering graphics is an effective way of communicating technical ideas and it is an essential tool in engineering design where most of the design process is graphically based. Engineering graphics is used in the design process for visualization, communication, and documentation. Graphics is a visual communications language that include images, text, and numeric information. Graphics communications using engineering drawings and models is a clear and precise language with definite rules that must be mastered in order to be successful in engineering design. Graphics communications are used in every phase of engineering design starting from concept illustration all the way to the manufacturing phase. An engineering (or technical) drawing is a graphical representation of a part, assembly, system, or structure and it can be produced using freehand, mechanical tools, or computer methods. Working drawings are the set of technical drawings used during the manufacturing phase of a product. They contain all the information needed to manufacture and assemble a product. 2.1.1.2 Codes and Standards Codes and standards are made to organize and unify the engineering work. Imagine; what if there was no standard for bolts? A code is a set of specifications for the analysis, design, manufacture, and construction of something. A standard is a set of specifications for parts, materials, or processes intended to achieve uniformity, efficiency and specific quality. Organizations Examples of the organizations that establish standards and design codes include: ISO, AISI, SAE, ASTM, ASME, ANSI, DIN. There are many different standards related to technical drawings. The ISO standards for technical drawings are found in a two-volume handbook: ISO Standards Handbook: Technical drawings, Volume 1: Technical drawings in general. ISO Standards Handbook: Technical drawings, Volume 2: Mechanical engineering drawings; Construction drawings; Drawing equipment. 2.1.1.3 Drawing Sheet Layout Standard layouts of drawing sheets are specified by the various standards organizations. The figure below shows the layout of a typical sheet, showing the drawing frame, a typical title block, parts list (bill of materials), and revision table. Figure 2.1: Title Block of Technical Drawing 2.1.1.3.1 Title Block Components (Lorier 2025) Part Title: The title is a descriptive name given to the drawing, typically the largest box in the title block. Company Information: The name of the company responsible for the drawing will also appear in a larger box in the title block. Often, a logo for the company will be displayed as well. Size: The size block displays the letter of the sheet size of the print (e.g., A, B, C, or A4, A3). Drawing Number: A numbering system the company uses to aid in filing and tracking the drawing. Part Number: A part number may be used to identify a specific part, such as in an assembly parts list. Scale: The scale displays the proportion of the drawing compared to the object. Reduction: When the part is too large to fit on the sheet, the drawing may be reduced to \\(1/2, 1/4, 1/8\\), etc. Enlargement: When the part is smaller than the sheet, the drawing may be increased proportionally. “DO” Scale: The ratio is arranged as Drawing:Object. A scale of 1:2 indicates the drawing is half the size of the part. A scale of 2:1 indicates the drawing is twice the size of the part. A scale of 1:1 or “Full” indicates they are the same size. NTS: Stands for “Not To Scale,” used if the drawing does not follow a basic proportional size. Drawn: Contains the name or initials of the drafter and the date of the drawing, as well as any other individuals involved (checkers, engineers). Projection: Identifies whether the drawing is a first-angle or third-angle projection. This is typically indicated with a standard projection cone symbol. Weight: Used to indicate the weight of the finished part when required. Sheet: Displays the current and total number of sheets in that drawing set (e.g., Sheet 1 of 3). Material: Identifies the specific material requirements for the part. Finish: Displays any part finish specifications. These may be indicated for specific regions using leader lines. Application: Used to identify the assemblies on which the part is used. 2.1.1.3.2 Tolerances Default Tolerance Box: Displays the amount of variation allowed on dimension values that do not have a specific tolerance attached to them. These are usually categorized by the number of decimal places. Figure 2.2: Default Tolerances Example based on Figure 7-3: * A two-place dimension of 2.00 allows for a \\(\\pm 0.02\\) tolerance (Range: \\(1.98\\) to \\(2.02\\)). * A three-place dimension of 2.000 allows for a \\(\\pm 0.010\\) tolerance (Range: \\(1.990\\) to \\(2.010\\)). 2.1.1.3.3 Document Control and Layout Revision: Revisions are changes made to the drawing after the original release to correct errors, improve design, or reduce manufacturing costs. The revision level (letter or number) is located in the lower right. The revision history is typically located in the upper right of the sheet. A dash (-) or the letter “A” often indicates the initial release. Zones: Sheet zones (using letters and numbers along the border) help locate particular details or views, which is especially beneficial on large-format drawings. 2.1.2 Dimensioning and Tolerancing Chapters and sections are numbered by default. To un-number a heading, add a {.unnumbered} or the shorter {-} at the end of the heading, like in this section. 2.2 Geometric Dimensioning and Tolerancing (GD&amp;T) References Hijazi, Rd. Ala. 2025.

Leave the label off if you like the automated heading generated based on your heading title: for example, # Hello world = # Hello world {#hello-world}. To label an un-numbered heading, use: # Hello world {-#nice-label} or {# Hello world .unnumbered}. Next, reference the labeled heading anywhere in the text using \\@ref(nice-label); for example, please see Chapter ??. If you prefer text as the link instead of a numbered reference use: any text you want can go here. 3.2 Captioned figures and tables Figures and tables with captions can also be cross-referenced from elsewhere in your book using \\@ref(fig:chunk-label) and \\@ref(tab:chunk-label), respectively.

Parts can be inserted at the top of an .Rmd file, before the first-level chapter heading in that same file. Add a numbered part: # (PART) Act one {-} (followed by # A chapter) Add an unnumbered part: # (PART\\*) Act one {-} (followed by # A chapter) Add an appendix as a special kind of un-numbered part: # (APPENDIX) Other stuff {-} (followed by # A chapter).

For example, we are using the bookdown package (Xie 2025) (check out the last code chunk in index.Rmd to see how this citation key was added) in this sample book, which was built on top of R Markdown and knitr (Xie 2015) (this citation was added manually in an external file book.bib). Note that the .bib files need to be listed in the index.Rmd with the YAML bibliography key. The RStudio Visual Markdown Editor can also make it easier to insert citations: https://rstudio.github.io/visual-markdown-editing/#/citations References Xie, Yihui. 2015.

If you’d like to customize your 404 page instead of using the default, you may add either a _404.Rmd or _404.md file to your project root and use code and/or Markdown syntax. 7.3 Metadata for sharing Bookdown HTML books will provide HTML metadata for social sharing on platforms like Twitter, Facebook, and LinkedIn, using information you provide in the index.Rmd YAML. To setup, set the url for your book and the path to your cover-image file. Your book’s title and description are also used. This gitbook uses the same social sharing data across all chapters in your book- all links shared will look the same. Specify your book’s source repository on GitHub using the edit key under the configuration options in the _output.yml file, which allows users to suggest an edit by linking to a chapter’s source file.
